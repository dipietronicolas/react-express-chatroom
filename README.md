# Fantastic Chat!

This project is a ChatRoom built with ReactJs, NodeJs, Express and WebSockets. I made it for a job interview i recently had, unfortunately i didn't get the job but at least i've learned a lot about how to communicate a react web app with the backend and the socket.io connection. And here is the result, you may watch this online at this link:

As a cool feature it has, you can send and image to other people in the chat and even add tags on it. People will recieve your image and the tags you added. 

# To run this proyect

1.- Install las version of nodeJs.

2.- Stand on the backend folder and run `npm install` command. This will install all the backend dependencies you'll need to run this program. Once it finishes run `npm run dev` or `npm start` command to make it start. It will run your app on the 4001 port.

3.- Stand on the frontend folder and run `npm install` command to install all the frontend dependencies, once it finishes run with the `npm start` command. Fantastic chat should be visible on localhost:3000.
